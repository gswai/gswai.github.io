- text: "As a data scientist, I work frequently with the following tools: the Python scientific and inferential stack, R, Jupyter, AWS, Google Cloud, SQL, Flask, Docker and a heavy handful of machine learning and probabilistic models. I work periodically with many more: Scala, Spark and React to name a few. I believe it crucial to be able to both build models and productionize one's own solutions."
