        On the weekends of 23 and 30 of november the Global Startup Weekend AI will go life in 15 cities. 

        The weekend event is centered on action, innovation, and education.  
        Beginning on Friday night with an idea pitching session and 
        continuing throughout the weekend with testing, business 
        model development, and basic prototype creation, Startup 
        Weekend culminates on Sunday night with demo pitching in 
        front of a panel of potential investors and local 
        entrepreneurs.  Participants are challenged with building 
        functional startups during the event and are able to 
        collaborate with like-minded individuals.
